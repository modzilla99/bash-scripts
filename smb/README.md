# SMB-Share AutoMount

This small script automatically mounts SMB/CIFS-Shares. To use it headlessly you need to save the password of the share into the Gnome-Keyring (seahorse) by doing it manually in Nautilus and saving the password by klicking on `Remember forever`.

## Run the script automatically

You can also add the script to run at login by adding it via `gnome-session-properties`. Just klick add give it a name and point it to the script, done.
